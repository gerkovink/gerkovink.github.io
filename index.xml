I aim to be at the cutting edge of both teaching and research and have an interest in new developments concerning the presentation of data, results and knowledge. I have a specific interest for problems where not all data is available (some information is left in the dark), information privacy, computational evaluation and programming. I am based in the Netherlands and work as an associate professor at Utrecht University (Utrecht, Netherlands).</description></item><item><title>Bami is awesome!</title><link>https://gerkovink.github.io/bami/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 06:44:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://gerkovink.github.io/bami/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Consultation</title><link>https://gerkovink.github.io/cnslt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 06:44:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://gerkovink.github.io/cnslt/</guid><description>I donate a some time every month to consult on missing data problems on the condition that it 1) helps humanity and/or the environment, AND 2) my contribution and the final work (e.g. a publication) ends up to be openly accessible or in the public domain.
I advice, train, manage and supervise governments, companies and researchers on inference and causal estimation problems with incomplete data. I am always available for consultation: drop me a line and we&amp;rsquo;ll take it from there.</description></item><item><title>Courses</title><link>https://gerkovink.github.io/crs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 06:44:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://gerkovink.github.io/crs/</guid><description>I teach courses about multiple imputation, data science, machine learning and statistical programming in R to students, companies, statistical professionals and applied researchers. Most of these courses can be considered professional continuing education at a post-graduate level. If you would like to hire me for a private course, contact me for a quote.
I can highly recommend the course Stef and I teach on Imputation in the Utrecht University Summerschool; you&amp;rsquo;ll get a comprehensive overview of the state of the art while keeping the course fee very affordable.</description></item><item><title>Development</title><link>https://gerkovink.github.io/dvlp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 06:44:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://gerkovink.github.io/dvlp/</guid><description>mice in R I actively develop for package mice in R.
Mice is an awesome piece of multiple imputation software that allows you to generate multivariate imputations via Fully Conditional Specification (FCS) and Joint Modeling. Have a look at the mice Github and the mice vignettes.
The mice package contains functions to:
Inspect the missing data pattern Impute the missing data $m$ times, resulting in $m$ completed data sets Diagnose the quality of the imputed values Analyse each completed data set Pool the results of the repeated analyses Store and export the imputed data in various formats to e.</description></item><item><title>Research activities</title><link>https://gerkovink.github.io/pubs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 06:44:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://gerkovink.github.io/pubs/</guid><description>Meet the research team: Stef van Buuren [Full prof] Mingyang Cai [PhD Student] Hanne Oberman [Phd Student] Thom Volker [Researcher] Anaïs Fopma [Graduate Student] For a more up-to date overview of my publications, see my CV or my Google Scholar page
