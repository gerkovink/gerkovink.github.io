#### Manuscripts for closed access publications
I choose to publish my own activities only under open access, copyleft licences or in the public domain. Sometimes I collaborate with others that do not have that flexibility. You can find the manuscripts for closed access publications in [this archive](https://github.com/gerkovink/published). If you feel you miss something, please drop me a line and I will add the corresponding file.
