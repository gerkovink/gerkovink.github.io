*I donate a some time every month to consult on missing data problems on the condition that it 1) helps humanity and/or the environment, AND 2) my contribution and the final work (e.g. a publication) ends up to be openly accessible or in the public domain.*

I advice, train, manage and supervise governments, companies and researchers on inference and causal estimation problems with incomplete data. I am always available for consultation: [drop me a line](mailto:g.vink@uu.nl) and we'll take it from there.

I have a broad experience as a consultant and have advised and trained government bodies, for-profit companies and institutions, NGOs, hospitals, universities and fellow researchers across the globe.
