<p align="justify">I am a statistician masquerading as a data scientist with a passion for educating people. I aim to be at the cutting edge of both teaching and research and have an interest in new developments concerning the presentation of data, results and knowledge. I have a specific interest for problems where not all data is available (some information is left in the dark), information privacy, computational evaluation and programming. I am based in the Netherlands and work as an associate professor at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>  (Utrecht, Netherlands).
<br><br>
I live my life with a wife and two kids, a surfboard and a pair of hiking shoes.
